# 2-Dimensional-Ping-Pong-Game
This is a two dimensional video game developed in Python 

Greetings all! I am back with another Repo! I developed a Ping-Pong (or just Pong)
game. However, I left out some components that are preventing it from moving (on purpose).
I challenge all to figure out why its not moving and enjoy it for yourself! 

Packages to install:

     pip install pygame
     pip install random (if you do not have it already)
     pip install sys (if you do not have it already)
     
Happy Coding!
